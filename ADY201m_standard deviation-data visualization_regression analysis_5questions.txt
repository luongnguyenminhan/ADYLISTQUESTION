What does the standard deviation measure in a dataset, and how does it relate to data variability?
A) Standard deviation measures the mean of the data, and it indicates how close data points are to the mean.
B) Standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of data points in a dataset, providing a quantifiable way to understand data variability.
C) Standard deviation calculates the median of a dataset, and it indicates data outliers.
D) Standard deviation measures the range of data values in a dataset.

When creating a scatter plot for data visualization, what does each point on the plot typically represent, and how is it used in regression analysis?
A) Each point represents a mean value, and it's used to calculate standard error.
B) Each point represents a data outlier, and it's used for data cleaning.
C) Each point represents an observation with two variables (X and Y), and it's used to visualize the relationship between these variables, often used in regression analysis.
D) Each point represents a prediction, and it's used for model validation.

In regression analysis, what is the primary goal when fitting a regression model to a dataset?
A) To calculate the standard error of the model
B) To create a scatter plot
C) To identify and quantify the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (response)
D) To compute the mean of the dependent variable

What is the formula to calculate the coefficient of determination (R-squared) in regression analysis, and what does R-squared represent?
A) R-squared = 1 - (Sum of Squared Residuals) / (Sum of Squared Total)
R-squared represents the correlation coefficient between two variables.
B) R-squared = (Sum of Squared Residuals) / (Sum of Squared Total)
R-squared represents the variance explained by the regression model.
C) R-squared = 1 - (Sum of Squared Residuals) / (Sum of Squared Explained Variance)
R-squared represents the significance level of the regression model.
D) R-squared = (Sum of Squared Residuals) / (Sum of Squared Explained Variance)
R-squared represents the model's standard error.

In statistics and probability, what is the central limit theorem, and why is it important in data analysis?
A) The central limit theorem states that the standard deviation of a sample is equal to the standard deviation of the population.
B) The central limit theorem states that the mean of a sufficiently large random sample follows a normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution. It's important because it allows for the application of many statistical techniques to non-normally distributed data.
C) The central limit theorem states that the variance of a sample is equal to the variance of the population.
D) The central limit theorem states that the sample size must always be small for valid statistical analysis.
