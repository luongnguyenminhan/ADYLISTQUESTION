In the data understanding phase, what is the primary goal of feature selection for a predictive modeling task?
A) To include all available features for maximum information
B) To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features
C) To overfit the model with a large number of features
D) To visualize the data distribution
ANSWER: B

During the data preparation phase, what is the purpose of imputing missing data, and what are some common techniques for imputation?
A) To ignore missing data; it has no impact on the model.
B) To fill in missing values with zeros.
C) To handle missing values to avoid bias in the analysis, and common techniques include mean imputation and predictive modeling-based imputation.
D) To remove rows with missing data from the dataset.
ANSWER: C

What is the term for the process of transforming categorical variables into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can work with during data preparation?
A) Categorical encoding
B) Categorical deletion
C) Categorical aggregation
D) Categorical visualization
ANSWER: A

In data preparation, what is the purpose of scaling and standardizing numerical features, and how does it impact machine learning algorithms?
A) Scaling and standardizing are not necessary in data preparation.
B) Scaling and standardizing help balance feature weights and ensure that features are on the same scale, improving algorithm performance, especially for distance-based algorithms.
C) Scaling and standardizing lead to overfitting.
D) Scaling and standardizing are only relevant for time series data.
ANSWER: B

What is the primary goal of data sampling in the data preparation phase, and what are two common types of data sampling techniques used in data science?
A) The goal is to introduce randomness into the dataset; common techniques include deterministic and stratified sampling.
B) The goal is to increase the dataset size; common techniques include oversampling and undersampling.
C) The goal is to remove outliers from the dataset; common techniques include mean removal and median filtering.
D) The goal is to aggregate data; common techniques include clustering and hierarchical sampling.
ANSWER: B
